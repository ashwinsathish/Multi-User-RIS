# Development and Implementation of a Simulation Concept for Multi-User RIS-aided Communication

This thesis presents a simulation framework for multi-user Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) communications in indoor environments at 300 GHz. As wireless networks evolve toward 6G, RIS technology has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing coverage and spectral efficiency through programmable electromagnetic environments. However, the integration of RIS in multi-user scenarios at THz frequencies introduces significant technical challenges, particularly in accurate propagation modeling and phase configuration optimization. The research develops two key components: an optimized RIS pattern generator and a specialized diagram interpolator for ray tracing simulations using TU Braunschweig's SiMoNe framework. The pattern generator implements a robust mathematical model for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, accounting for hardware constraints, phase quantization, and efficiency factors. Spatial resolution and user capacity analysis validates the effectiveness of the pattern generator, for practical deployment. The diagram interpolator integrates these optimized patterns into ray tracing simulations, enabling comprehensive channel impulse response and power distribution analysis in indoor environments. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in existing simulation approaches by incorporating optimized gain pattern analysis, codebook-based interpolator design for the ray tracer and THz-specific propagation phenomena. Results demonstrate that the model successfully characterizes RIS behavior under various conditions, with multi-user configurations achieving balanced gain distribution for simultaneously served users. This research contributes to advancing RIS-aided communication systems by providing tools for realistic performance evaluation.
